# Tax revenues as a share of GDP - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["Tax revenues as a share of GDP"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-revenues-as-a-share-of-gdp-unu-wider?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=false) on the Our World in Data website.

## CSV Structure

The high level structure of the CSV file is that each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) and a timepoint (usually a year).

The first two columns in the CSV file are "Entity" and "Code". "Entity" is the name of the entity (e.g. "United States"). "Code" is the OWID internal entity code that we use if the entity is a country or region. For normal countries, this is the same as the [iso alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code of the entity (e.g. "USA") - for non-standard countries like historical countries these are custom codes.

The third column is either "Year" or "Day". If the data is annual, this is "Year" and contains only the year as an integer. If the column is "Day", the column contains a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The remaining columns are the data columns, each of which is a time series. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "full data" option, then each column corresponds to one time series below. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "only selected data visible in the chart" option then the data columns are transformed depending on the chart type and thus the association with the time series might not be as straightforward.

## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc.. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc..

## About the data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stich together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

### How we process data at Our World In Data
All data and visualizations on Our World in Data rely on data sourced from one or several original data providers. Preparing this original data involves several processing steps. Depending on the data, this can include standardizing country names and world region definitions, converting units, calculating derived indicators such as per capita measures, as well as adding or adapting metadata such as the name or the description given to an indicator.

### What you should know about this data
* Taxes are defined as compulsory, unrequited payments to the government, following IMF and OECD definitions.
* Resource taxes (mostly related to oil and mining) are not systematically defined or captured in the data.
* Social contributions include both compulsory and voluntary social insurance contributions from employers, employees, and the self-employed.

### How is this data described by its producer - UNU-WIDER Government Revenue Dataset (2023)?
The variable Taxes captures tax collected regardless of sources (i.e., unless otherwise defined, this includes resource-based taxes). These follow the definition of taxes found in both the IMF’ Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) and OECD Revenue Statistics Interpretive Guide as ‘compulsory, unrequited …’ payments to the government (IMF 2014; OECD 2020).

The Taxes variables presents aggregate indicators that capture all tax revenue as defined above. Resource taxes typically present taxes levied on natural resource extraction, although differ across territories. Resource Taxes are not (systematically) defined or captured in the OECD Revenue Statistics, and not captured at all in the IMF’s GFS, thus do not have a separate code for either publication.

Social contributions include both compulsory and voluntary social insurance contributions from employers, employees, and the self-employed.

#### Notes on our processing step for this indicator
The source provides their data with caution notes, classifying them as follows:

  1. Accuracy, quality or comparability of data questionable.
  2. Un-excluded resource revenues/taxes are significant but cannot be isolated from total revenue/taxes.
  3. Un-excluded resource revenue/taxes are marginal but non-negligible and cannot be isolated from total revenue/taxes.
  4. Inconsistencies with social contributions.

We have excluded from our dataset the observations flagged with caution note 1.
